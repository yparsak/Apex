# Docker CLI Cheat Sheet

## IMAGES
Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

- **Build an Image from a Dockerfile:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t <image_name> .
  ```
- **Build an Image from a Dockerfile without the cache:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t <image_name> --no-cache .
  ```
- **List local images:**
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
- **Delete an Image:**
  ```bash
  docker rmi <image_name>
  ```
- **Remove all unused images:**
  ```bash
  docker image prune
  ```

## DOCKER HUB
Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. 
Learn more and find images at [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).

- **Login into Docker:**
  ```bash
  docker login -u <username>
  ```
- **Publish an image to Docker Hub:**
  ```bash
  docker push <username>/<image_name>
  ```
- **Search Hub for an image:**
  ```bash
  docker search <image_name>
  ```
- **Pull an image from Docker Hub:**
  ```bash
  docker pull <image_name>
  ```

## GENERAL COMMANDS
- **Start the docker daemon:**
  ```bash
  dockerd
  ```
- **Get help with Docker (can also use `--help` on all subcommands):**
  ```bash
  docker --help
  ```
- **Display system-wide information:**
  ```bash
  docker info
  ```

## CONTAINERS
A container is a runtime instance of a docker image. A container will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. 
Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

- **Create and run a container from an image, with a custom name:**
  ```bash
  docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>
  ```
- **Run a container and publish a container's port(s) to the host:**
  ```bash
  docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
  ```
- **Run a container in the background:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d <image_name>
  ```
- **Start or stop an existing container:**
  ```bash
  docker start <container_name_or_id>
  docker stop <container_name_or_id>
  ```
- **Remove a stopped container:**
  ```bash
  docker rm <container_name>
  ```
- **Open a shell inside a running container:**
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container_name> sh
  ```
- **Fetch and follow the logs of a container:**
  ```bash
  docker logs -f <container_name>
  ```
- **Inspect a running container:**
  ```bash
  docker inspect <container_name_or_id>
  ```
- **List currently running containers:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- **List all docker containers (running and stopped):**
  ```bash
  docker ps --all
  ```
- **View resource usage stats:**
  ```bash
  docker container stats
  ```
